- Creating a new node with a manually set alias and not unchecking
  the checkbox results in two aliases, one saved by pathauto and one by
  PathItem. A possible clean way to do this might be to replace the PathItem
  class with a ustom one and completely replace the logic there. Or fix core to
  make sure that it sets ->pid after saving a new alias.
